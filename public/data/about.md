Hi, I’m Syed Sibte Haider, a Principal Software Developer with over 12 years of experience building scalable, enterprise-grade applications. My journey into technology began with a Bachelor’s degree in Electronics Engineering from Sir Syed University, where I graduated as a Silver Medalist and earned numerous scholarships across my four-year degree program. During my undergraduate studies, I discovered a strong inclination toward programming, which gradually shaped my career direction.


Motivated by this growing passion, I went on to pursue a Master’s degree in Computer Science from FAST-NUCES, bridging the gap between my electronics background and software development. This combination of hardware, systems thinking, and software engineering laid a strong foundation for my professional career.


I started my career in 2012 as a Network Engineer, but I soon realized that this field did not align with my interests. In February 2013, I transitioned into software development after being hired as a Java Developer at Workstream Automation. Alongside my professional responsibilities, I continued learning independently, explored Android development, and built several hobby projects. At Workstream, I worked on Vaadin-based enterprise applications and also led a mobile development team.


Later, I joined Habib Bank Limited (HBL) as a Product Engineer, where I worked across multiple technologies — from backend Java to Android development and React Native. During my time there, I contributed to major products including the HBL Mobile App and Branchless Banking solutions.


I then moved to Contour Software, where I spent five years with the Equivant Division working on JWorks, a full-stack application that automates judicial processes for courts and justice systems across the United States. At Contour, I had the opportunity to work extensively on both backend systems and frontend development using JavaScript, further strengthening my full-stack capabilities.


Today, I work as a Principal Software Developer with the Bookassist Division at Contour Software, where I design and develop booking engine solutions for the hospitality industry. My role also involves mentoring junior developers and driving the adoption of modern technologies and best practices within the team.


Beyond my professional work, I am deeply passionate about sharing knowledge and mentoring others. In 2023, I served as a Lead Trainer for Pakistan’s first-ever free IT bootcamp, TechLift — an initiative by P@SHA, PSEB, and Excellence Delivered. I designed the curriculum and trained unemployed graduates in Java and Spring Boot, helping them launch their careers in software development. Later, I also worked as a trainer at CodeGirls, continuing my efforts to support and grow the local tech community.


I believe in writing clean, maintainable code, continuously learning, and building systems that make a real-world impact. Whether it’s designing scalable backend services, working across the full stack, or mentoring aspiring developers, I take pride in everything I build and contribute to.
